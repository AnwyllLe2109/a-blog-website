Name: A blog website

Description: This is a website I created to test my current ability with web development after 3rd semester at my college.

Stack requirement: html, css, bootstrap, mongo, express.js, jquery, handlebars, cient-session

Web requirement: 
 - Must be able to store blog, account user on mongo
 - Should be mobile - laptop friendly
 - The design should use bootstrap for the front end
 - The account information must be encrypted

 Struggles and issues:

    1. Basic setup - 16/8/2022 - 5:20pm
        - Right now I haven't used handlebars yet. As the result right now I need to import path to render the html files
    2. 22-08-2022 - 12:53am
        - Changed all the html to hbs, editing the main page
        - Need to understand the use of app.use() (express)
        - The design would be blue and white(update the color later)
